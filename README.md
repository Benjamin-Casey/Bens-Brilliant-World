# Bens-Brilliant-World

Hello and congratulations @everyone ! You've been invited to: **Ben's Brilliant World!**

We'll be playing: Vanilla Minecraft! But wait, before you all turn away - hit that snooze button, there's a twist! Every now and again we'll play a game! 

"What game", you ask?

Everyone on the server will vote on one of three random events! These events may be harmful to player/s, helpful, or neutral! They may range from being something boring like, get 20 iron, to spawn harmful enemies, gain random status effects such as levitate, etc. etc.

To make it more interesting, stakes could be added - hardcore server, teams (without pvp), etc.

Now that everyone is excited to play, allow me to ask of you all the follow: I need everyone to contribute to a list of events for this to work! There will be a prize for the person that puts forward the most interesting event!
